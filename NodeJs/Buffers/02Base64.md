What is Base64 (simple definition)

Base64 is a way to represent binary data using only readable ASCII characters.

It is encoding, not encryption, not compression.

Why Base64 even exists (the real need)

Originally, many systems could only safely handle text:

Emails (SMTP)

JSON

URLs

HTTP headers

HTML

Binary data (images, PDFs, buffers):

Contains non-printable bytes

Can break text-based systems

👉 So we needed a way to:
Convert binary → safe text

That’s exactly what Base64 does.

Why it’s called “Base64”

Base64 uses 64 characters:

A–Z  (26)
a–z  (26)
0–9  (10)
+ /
----------------
Total = 64


Plus:

= for padding

These characters are safe in almost all text systems.

How Base64 works (conceptually)
Step 1: Start with binary data

Example:

"Man"


ASCII:

M = 77
a = 97
n = 110


Binary (8 bits each):

01001101 01100001 01101110

Step 2: Split into 6-bit groups

Why 6 bits?

2⁶ = 64 characters

010011 010110 000101 101110

Step 3: Map each 6-bit value to Base64 table
010011 = 19 → T
010110 = 22 → W
000101 = 5  → F
101110 = 46 → u


Result:

TWFu

Padding with =

If input length is not multiple of 3 bytes:

Base64 adds = or ==

Examples:

"M" → TQ==

"Ma" → TWE=

"Man" → TWFu

Padding helps decoder know how many bytes to restore.

Important property (interview favorite)

Base64 increases size by ~33%.

Why?

3 bytes (24 bits) → 4 Base64 chars (32 bits)

So:

Original: 3 bytes
Base64:   4 bytes

Base64 in Node.js (Buffers)
Encode Buffer → Base64
const buf = Buffer.from("hello");
const b64 = buf.toString("base64");

console.log(b64); // aGVsbG8=

Decode Base64 → Buffer
const decoded = Buffer.from(b64, "base64");
console.log(decoded.toString()); // hello

Very common real-world uses
1. Sending images in JSON
{
  "image": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
}

2. Data URLs
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..." />

3. JWT tokens

JWT parts are Base64URL encoded.

4. Basic Auth
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
